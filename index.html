          "A rocket is a missile, spacecraft, aircraft or other vehicle that obtains thrust from a rocket engine. Rocket engine exhaust is formed entirely from propellant carried within the rocket." That's the wikipedia definition for one of, if not the most powerful constructions by humanity. This technical document will not be as conventional as the rest as I am not a technical writer, however, I will do my best to break down the main parts of the rocket(with a focus on the type used to reach orbit or thereabouts).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In this document, we will cover(briefly) the following:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>the structure of a rocket</li>
          <li>rocket payload</li>
          <li>guidance systems</li>
          <li>rocket propulsion</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><i>.....3...2..1. Let's begin!!</i></p>

      <section id="Structure" class="main-section">
        <header>Structure</header>
        <p>
          The structure of a rocket can be defined as <i>the body tube, motor mounts as well as mounting of any other components inside the rocket</i>. More simply put, the structure is essentially the flusk/tower/cylinder with a cone on top that is visible along with the objects(mounts) used to hold together the fuel tanks, the engine(s) etc. The structure of the rocket has to be strong but lightweight as well. Strong, to withstand the forces associated with overcoming the pull of gravity(think about it, when you jump you cant stay airborn for more than a second or so, how is a tower weighing more than a dosen elephants going to do it). Lightweight to reduce the amount of force required to get off the ground. Gravity, again!

          Materials commonly used to build rocket bodies include:
        </p>
          
        <ul>
          <li>aluminum</li>
          <li>titanium</li>
        <ul>
      </section>
      
      <section id="Payload" class="main-section">
        <header>Payload</header>
        <p>
          This refers to what is being transported via the rocket, also, do not be deceived by a rockets size. More often than not, only a fraction of the structure will reach out of space as rockets tend to this thing know as "stage separation" where engine, empty fuel tanks etc are shed to reduce mass. The phrase "Payload Capacity" refers to how much a rocket can actually carry, whether it be people, satellites, equipment etc.

      <section id="Guidance" class="main-section">
        <header>Guidance</header>
        <p>
          The guidance system of a rocket includes very sophisticated sensors, on-board computers, radars, and communication equipment. The guidance system has two main roles during the launch of a rocket; to provide stability for the rocket, and to control the rocket during maneuvers. A rocket does not travel straight up, initially it does but after a while the trajectory of the rocket begins tilting. So at first glance it seems straight forward but keeping a rocket on track is a more difficult than one realizes. 
        </p>
          
        <p>
          Two methods for maintaining control or keeping the rocket on track are:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Gimbaled thrust</li>
          <li>Vernier rockets</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      
      <section id="Propulsion" class="main-section">
        <header>Propulsion</header>
        <p>
           The propulsion of a rocket includes all of the parts which make up the rocket engine; the tanks pumps, propellants, power head, and rocket nozzle . The function of the propulsion system is to produce thrust. Thrust is the force which moves a rocket through the air and through space. Thrust is generated by the propulsion system of the rocket.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          There are two main categories of rocket engines:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li> In a liquid rocket, the propellants, the fuel and the oxidizer, are stored separately as liquids and are pumped into the combustion chamber of the nozzle where burning occurs.</li>
          <li> In a solid rocket, the propellants are mixed together and packed into a solid cylinder.</li>
        </ul>
